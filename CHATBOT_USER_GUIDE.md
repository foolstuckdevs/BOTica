## üéØ Optimization Tips

### Getting Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include drug name, strength, and form when possible

   - Good: "paracetamol 500mg tablet dosage"
   - Avoid: "pain medicine dosage"

2. **Use Standard Names**: Use generic or common brand names

   - Good: "paracetamol" or "biogesic"
   - Avoid: "that fever medicine"

3. **Single Focus**: Ask one question at a time for clearest results

   - Good: "stock level for amoxicillin 500mg"
   - Avoid: "tell me everything about amoxicillin"

4. **Professional Terms**: Use pharmacy terminology
   - Good: "indications", "contraindications", "dosage form"
   - Avoid: "what's it for", "how bad is it"

### Understanding Responses

- **Concise Format**: Responses are deliberately brief and factual
- **Source Attribution**: Always check the sources listed at bottom
- **Professional Language**: Uses clinical terminology familiar to pharmacists
- **Compliance First**: Safety and legal compliance prioritized over convenience

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "I don't have that information right now"

**Cause**: Information not available in BOTica's approved sources
**Solution**:

- Try rephrasing with generic drug name
- Check official pharmaceutical references manually
- Verify product exists in your inventory system

#### Chatbot provides general info instead of specific dosage

**Cause**: Product classified as prescription medication
**Solution**: This is correct behavior - consult prescribing physician for prescription dosages

#### Response seems too brief

**Cause**: BOTica uses strict templates to prevent over-answering
**Solution**: This is intentional - ask follow-up questions if more detail needed

#### Chatbot says "I'm a pharmacy assistant focused on medication inventory..."

**Cause**: Query was detected as out-of-scope (non-pharmacy related)
**Solution**: This is correct behavior - rephrase your question to focus on:
- Medication names, stock, or pricing
- Drug information or dosage guidance
- Pharmacy inventory management
**Examples**: Instead of "How are you?" ask "Do we have paracetamol in stock?"

#### Different sources show conflicting information

**Cause**: Legitimate differences between international and local sources
**Solution**: This is intentional behavior - BOTica shows both viewpoints separately
**Example**: "OpenFDA states X. MIMS Philippines states Y."
**Action**: Use professional judgment to determine which applies to your situation

#### Stock information doesn't match current inventory

**Cause**: Database sync delay or product name mismatch
**Solution**:

- Verify product name spelling
- Check inventory system directly
- Report persistent discrepancies to system administrator

## üìû Support & Maintenance
