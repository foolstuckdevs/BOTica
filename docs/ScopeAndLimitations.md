**Scope and Limitations**

This study focused on the design, development, and implementation of **BOTica: A Chatbot Integrated Inventory and Sales System**, specifically tailored for *Farmacia Dulnuan*, located at Purok 5, Brgy. Poblacion, Kasibu, Nueva Vizcaya. The system aimed to automate core pharmacy operations and improve staff efficiency through a centralized and intelligent platform.

### **Scope of the Study**

The system’s development covered the following key features and modules:

*   **Point-of-Sale (POS) Module** – Facilitates real-time transaction processing, automatically updates inventory levels upon purchase, and generates digital or printable purchase receipts.
*   **Inventory Management & Stock Control** – Tracks product inflow and outflow, monitors stock levels, and provides automated alerts for **low-stock** items and **near-expiry** medicines to prevent spoilage and stockouts.
*   **Intelligent Chatbot Assistant (PNF Integrated)** – A specialized chatbot powered by the **Philippine National Formulary (PNF)** knowledge base. It assists the pharmacist and staff in quickly looking up **medicine information**, including dosage, contraindications, side effects, and drug interactions.
*   **Analytics Dashboard** – Provides a visual overview of business performance, displaying **daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends**, as well as critical inventory status (e.g., fast-moving items, critical stock levels).
*   **Reports Generation** – Automates the creation of comprehensive **Sales Reports** and **Inventory Reports** for auditing and decision-making.
*   **Supplier & Purchase Order Management** – Manages supplier details and tracks purchase orders to streamline the restocking process.
*   **User Management & Security** – Implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to define permissions for different user roles (e.g., Admin, Pharmacist, Staff), ensuring data security and accountability.

### **Limitations of the Study**

The study was conducted with the following constraints:

*   **Customization Specificity** – The system’s workflow and features were customized specifically for the operational needs of *Farmacia Dulnuan* and may require configuration adjustments for adoption in other pharmacy settings.
*   **Chatbot Scope** – The chatbot is designed solely as a **drug reference tool** for pharmacy staff. It utilizes the PNF database for information retrieval but does **not** perform medical diagnosis, issue prescriptions, or provide direct medical advice to patients.
*   **Hardware Dependency** – The system is a web-based application requiring a stable internet connection for the chatbot (AI API) and cloud database features to function optimally.
*   **Offline Capability** – The current version primarily operates online; full offline functionality for transactions during internet outages is outside the scope of this version.
*   **Participants** – The study’s testing and evaluation were limited to the owner and staff of *Farmacia Dulnuan*.

While the system successfully addresses the pharmacy’s key operational needs—such as inventory tracking, sales processing, and information retrieval—it acknowledges limitations in offline redundancy and broader medical capabilities, which serve as opportunities for future development.
