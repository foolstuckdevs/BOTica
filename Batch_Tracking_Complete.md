## 🎉 Batch Tracking Implementation Complete!

### ✅ **What We've Fixed:**

1. **Removed Barcode Unique Constraint**

   - Migration `0024_mushy_zemo.sql` applied successfully
   - Same barcode can now have multiple entries (different batches)

2. **Updated Validation Logic**
   - Now checks for `barcode + lotNumber` combination instead of just product name
   - Allows same product (same barcode) with different lot numbers
   - Handles cases where barcode might be null/undefined

### 🚀 **How It Works Now:**

**Scenario 1: Same Product, Different Batches**

```
✅ Product 1: Paracetamol | Barcode: 12345 | Lot: BATCH-A | Exp: 2026-01
✅ Product 2: Paracetamol | Barcode: 12345 | Lot: BATCH-B | Exp: 2026-06
```

**Scenario 2: Same Product, Same Batch (Error)**

```
❌ Product 1: Paracetamol | Barcode: 12345 | Lot: BATCH-A | Exp: 2026-01
❌ Product 2: Paracetamol | Barcode: 12345 | Lot: BATCH-A | Exp: 2025-12
    → Error: "This lot number already exists for this product"
```

### 📋 **Your Enhanced Manual Workflow:**

1. **Create Purchase Order** (documentation)
2. **Mark items as received** with quantities
3. **Click "Add to Inventory"** (pre-fills: name, quantity, cost, supplier)
4. **Pharmacist fills in**:
   - Product name (pre-filled) ✅
   - Barcode ✅
   - **Lot Number** ✅ (key field for batch tracking)
   - Expiry Date ✅
   - Category, unit, etc. ✅
5. **Submit** → ✅ **Success!** (No more barcode conflicts)

### 🧪 **Ready to Test:**
